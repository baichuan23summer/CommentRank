"4.0 out of 5 starsChocolate Good, But Label Accurate?",4.0 out of 5 stars,"The quality of the chocolate I received was excellent.  However, the box containing the candy bars had been opened before I received it, and it was apparent from the shape and the consistency of the candy bars that either the manufacturing process for them has changed, the ingredients have, or the candy bars were counterfeit.  One I threw away.Anyone with allergies should take note, and proceed with caution, although, in this instance, the issue appears likely to be specific to Amazon, as opposed to the manufacturer, whether the packaging problem occurred before Amazon received damaged product and just passed it on to consumers rather than rejecting the goods, damage occurred in the Amazon warehouse or delivery process, or occurred after delivery, when the package sat unattended because, once again, my specific written delivery instructions were completely disregarded."
3.0 out of 5 starsMissing,3.0 out of 5 stars,The box I received was missing candy bars.  It should contain 18 and I received 16.  However u will keep this item but for future orders I expect to received the complete 18 count as stated.

5.0 out of 5 starsFull Size Chocolate Candy bars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price it's not a bad buy, tho it didn't arrive for Halloween my daughter and I got to enjoy the chocolate bars ourselves. The favorites in this box don't last as long as the ok candy bars included do. Maybe that's because there's more snickers in this box than the other more favored chocolate bars."

5.0 out of 5 starsi like them,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i wish there were more twix bars ,good candy bars"
5.0 out of 5 starsAwesome,5.0 out of 5 stars,I came back to write a review not only about the product but the way Amazon packaged my item. The chocolate bars were fresh and amazing for my family outing. The color and texture was perfect.Amazon packaged my item in a box with insulation and an ice pack! I was very impressed. Not a single melted one. Good job Amazon for going above and beyond to insure quality of the product.
4.0 out of 5 starsNot fresh product,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this product from my subscribe and save purchase. When I ordered and received this product I was expecting to receive a product that was not expired. The candy had an old taste , especially the 3 musketeers bars. O was very disappointed with this order. Please send consumers fresh and quality product, not something you are trying to get rid of. Will not order again unless this issue is addressed promptly."
5.0 out of 5 starsFull box,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what I needed. Would purchase again.
"5.0 out of 5 starsThey knocked it out of the park, but came up short.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent candy bars that we put out for the delivery people who come up our long driveway to place the packages on our front porch.  This Variety Mix satisfies them all!  The shipment packaging was incredible; a well insulated cardboard box and even a Nordic Ice cool pack all shipped 2 day air!  Amazon went above and beyond on this purchase.  Wow!  But inside the still sealed candy box was just 15 bars instead of the 18 bars advertised.  Somehow we were shorted 3 Snickers bars.  I'm not complaining, it's probably a rare event and won't happen again.  I will reorder."
5.0 out of 5 starsVariety is key to the indecisive taste bud,5.0 out of 5 stars,With this full size variety  you can solve your taste buds cravings enjoy a snickers pr maybe an M&M starburst or skittle  3 musketeers to meet this pack is a dream.
3.0 out of 5 starsOn time but a pack of the m&Ms had a slit when I opened box,3.0 out of 5 stars,A pack of my Candy was slit open
5.0 out of 5 starsFresh and well packaged at a great price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these as a gift for the neighbor kids right after Halloween but decided to just keep them for myself!  An impulse buy; PSA be careful not to drink and shop! haha. But at the cost of 12.69 for 18 candy bars that cost 21.99 at Safeway, I thought why not buy them for my neighbors who have six kids, but then felt a bit funny about giving all this candy to them and I don't know if the parents who are my friends would really appreciate giving them so much candy, right after they already had a lot of candy after trick or treating. Great and perfect mix of some of my favorite candy bars of all time too! 6 Snickers bars, 5 Twix, 4 Three Musketeers and three Milkyway bars. I might wait till it's down to the last 6 or 12 left and give them to the kids, as I really don't eat a lot of candy anymore."
5.0 out of 5 starsBueno,5.0 out of 5 stars,Muy bien gracias
5.0 out of 5 starsGood value,5.0 out of 5 stars,I only buy candy bars this way. So much cheaper than one at a time. My husband takes them in his lunch.
5.0 out of 5 starsGreat Snack,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasn't going to write a review on this because I'm almost certain everyone has tried at least one or the other at least once. However I have to tell the story on my 4 yr old son who apparently likes these alot ..lol I had purchased these for him as a treat but I thought I was being smart by hiding these in the closet and only allowing a half a bar at a time. Yea that didn't work out quite the way I had planned, he found the box and got suspiciously quite .As I rounded the corner to see what was happening, I found him sitting on a box of blankets having a hay day with all that chocolate...lol I won't say I'll never purchase these again because I definitely will , just need to find a different hiding spot!"
5.0 out of 5 starsChocolate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Need I say more? Great value.
5.0 out of 5 starsNice assortment,5.0 out of 5 stars,These were for the kids at church.
5.0 out of 5 starsVery Fresh and Great Value,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The candy was packed very well with an ice pack. The candy was nice and cool to the touch outside the wrappers. I read on previous reviews that it shipped with cold pack. This is a really good value compared to buying individual bars in a store. I tried the Musketeer bar and it is SO fresh.  In the picture, you can see it is not old or ashy or anything....this candy is very very fresh. You won't be disappointed."

4.0 out of 5 starsYummy,4.0 out of 5 stars,These candy bars were very fresh! I hate when I order any kind of candy online and they're stale or hard as a rock...not these...they were Yummy!
"4.0 out of 5 starsGood value especially with Subscribe & Save, but quality has been going down",4.0 out of 5 stars,"A box of 18 candy bars for $10.70 or so seems good value to me.  I order by Subscribe & Save to get that price.  A monthly delivery also helps me limit my candy bar intake.  I've probably ordered 10 boxes over the last year.  Amazon originally wrapped each box in a cooler bag for summer deliveries, but last summer they just suspended sales.  Over the last few months (Dec 2018-March 2019), quality has started to go down, particularly the 3 Musketeers and Snickers bars.  The expiry date was approx 7 months from when I received delivery (so that definitely WON'T be a problem).  However, 3 Musketeers and Snickers bars have had hard centers, so much so that I nearly broke a front tooth biting into a 3 Musketeers and it made a distinct snapping sound when I bit into it.  The centers are supposed to be light and fluffy!  Several Snickers bars were lightly crunchy, not soft and caramelly.  The chocolate coating was OK with no sign of heat damage.  There's definitely a quality-control problem here, I suspect with storage and transport.EDIT: I contacted the manufacturer Mars. They were polite but not overly interested.  They sent me two $5-off manufacturer coupons that I cannot use on Amazon.  I did my own quality control tests and discovered the bad candy bars were not sealed airtight--the heat seals at both ends of the wrapper were not sealed, allowing air to leak in and oxidize the candy.  Obviously a manufacturing problem. I let Mars know but didn't hear back from them.  I'm sure they knew it already."

5.0 out of 5 starsValue,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought it out of a vending machine at the hospital. I moaned groaned and complained about the hospital charges being $2:75 cents!
